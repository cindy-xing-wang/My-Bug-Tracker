# My Bug Tracker

This is a Laravel 8 web application to manage projects and related issues. There two roles: Admin and developer. Admin has full authorization including view, create, update, delete projects, bugs and assign bugs to developers. Developer role only can view, create and update projects and related issues. I am using this app now to track the bugs I found for this project and still working on it.
